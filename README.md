# road-parser
Parses WKT csv files generated from subsets of the data.vic.gov.au road network shapefile. 

Run as ```roadroad_networkx.py INPUT_FILE``` . Will currently just load network into a networkx directed graph and plot with matplotlib.

Future updates wil include pickling graph, and exporting all shortest path pairs.
